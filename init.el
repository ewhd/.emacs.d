;; The purpose of this file is to set a few things to optimize load time, but
;; mostly to source the file ewhd-emacs-init.el

;; Portions of the this file are borrowed from https://github.com/CSRaghunandan/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el

;; Every file opened and loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for
;; a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it wonâ€™t need any of them.
